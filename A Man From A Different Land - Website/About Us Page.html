        <h1>About Us</h1>

        <h2>Our Inspiration</h2>

        <h3>Immigration is a troubling issue, many immigrants try to come over to America and other countries to escape from any troubles left behind in their home country. <br>
            But the system has become more strict and now immigrants face many problems while migrating to America. <br>
            Mexicans face the most out of this ordeal, Mexico is dealing with many problems and the people just want to be free of it,
             but the system won’t allow them through unless they meet expectations that they can’t usually afford. <br>
            With the issues Mexican immigrants face, we were inspired to create our game based on “The Oregon Trail”.
